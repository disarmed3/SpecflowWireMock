# Credit Card Payment Automation

This project is an automated testing framework for a credit card payment feature.  
It utilizes SpecFlow for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and NUnit for unit testing.  
The program simulates a credit card payment process using WireMock to mock the backend service.  

## Packages Used  

- **SpecFlow**: A tool for Behavior-Driven Development that allows writing tests in a natural language format.  
- **NUnit**: A popular testing framework for .NET applications that facilitates the creation and execution of unit tests.  
- **WireMock**: A library for mocking HTTP requests, allowing for easy simulation of a web service without the need for a live server.  
- **System.Net.Http**: Provides a programming interface for modern HTTP applications, used for sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP responses.  

## Purpose  

The purpose of this project is to automate the testing of credit card payment functionality, ensuring that transactions are processed correctly and simulating responses from a backend service using WireMock.
